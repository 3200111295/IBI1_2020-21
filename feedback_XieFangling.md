I'm sorrt that I forgot to submit my username so I didn't receive the Formative Feedback.

But I asked my classmates and read their feedback to know the score standards.So I made some corrections as well.

Practical 4
I didn't change the content of file index.md so it was same as rob's. I have changed it now.

Practical 5
I used "def" in almost all the tasks. It's not the easiest way to solve these problems so I made some changes.

Practical 6
I forgot to use pseudocode,just draw the charts. So I added the pseudocode to it.
